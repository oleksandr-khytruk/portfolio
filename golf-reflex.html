						<div class="overview">
							<p>
								In this case study, I’d like to share our experience working on
								a small but intense XR experiment - a mini-golf game built for
								Apple Vision Pro. I’ll walk you through the project’s context,
								the UX challenges we faced, and the lessons we learned from
								building an MVP in just two weeks.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>My role & contribution</h4>
						<p>
							As the UX/UI designer, I was responsible for shaping the entire
							product experience - from defining the core concept and
							interaction model to designing the interface and assets for Vision
							Pro.
						</p>
						<p>
							I collaborated closely with the developer to adapt 2D designs into
							a 3D spatial environment, ensured gesture-based controls were
							intuitive, and helped tailor the app for quick, event-based
							engagement.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="case-study-block accent-bg">
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>The Ask</h4>
						<p>
							This entire project began with an unexpected pitch from
							leadership:
						</p>
						<div class="citation">
							<p>
								What if we created a fun, interactive Vision Pro experience for
								a tech showcase at the Emerald Valley Golf Classic in Oregon?
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							The event, scheduled for April 15 in Eugene, was a high-end
							networking event targeting potential enterprise clients. Our goal?
							To use Vision Pro not just as a conversation starter, but as a
							living demo of our team's creativity, tech capabilities, and
							design thinking.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="accent"><strong>The concept:</strong></p>
						<p>
							A light, beginner-friendly VR experience where users could try a
							golf swing in mixed reality, guided by simple visual instructions.
						</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="case-study-block">
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>Project Scope & Timeline</h4>
						<p>
							There was one major challenge. We had only 14 days to design and
							ship a working MVP.
						</p>
						<p>In that short time, we had to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Learn the fundamentals of golf mechanics (like proper stance and
								swing form)
							</li>
							<li>Understand spatial design on Vision Pro</li>
							<li>
								Define interaction patterns that worked without physical
								controllers
							</li>
							<li>Deliver something both delightful and demo-ready</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<p>
							We knew this wouldn’t be a polished game, but it had to be
							functional, intuitive, and visually compelling.
						</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-block accent-bg">
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>UX Challenges</h4>
						<p class="accent">
							<strong>1. No Direct Access to Vision Pro</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Only one developer on our team had access to the device, which
							made design validation extremely tricky.
						</p>
						<p>
							We couldn't test interactions ourselves, meaning every layout or
							gesture decision was based on assumptions, documentation, and
							secondhand feedback.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="accent"><strong>2. Designing for Gestures</strong></p>
						<p>
							One of our concepts assumed that players’ hands would be occupied,
							as they physically mimic real golf swings. Because of this,
							traditional hand gestures for navigation weren’t practical. We
							explored alternative ways to progress through tutorial steps or
							reset the game without requiring touch input.
						</p>
						<p>Key questions we considered:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								How can players advance to the next instruction hands-free?
							</li>
							<li>What happens if someone exits the app mid-swing?</li>
							<li>
								Should UI elements be mirrored for left- and right-handed users?
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<p class="accent"><strong>3. Identity & Onboarding</strong></p>
						<p>
							Vision Pro uses optical authentication to unlock the device based
							on eye and face scanning inside the headset. There’s no multi-user
							or guest mode, only the registered user can unlock it. Shared use
							requires re-authentication, limiting convenience in group
							settings.
						</p>
						<img src="images/golf-challenges.png" /><br />
						<h4>Research & Brainstorming</h4>
						<p>Without access to the hardware, we relied heavily on:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Apple’s official visionOS Human Interface Guidelines</li>
							<li>Developer blogs and early adopters’ reviews</li>
							<li>YouTube demos and tear-downs from creators</li>
							<li>Analysis of early Vision Pro apps and games</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<br />We documented key interaction patterns, gesture libraries,
							and performance bottlenecks other creators had run into, which
							helped us avoid some of the same mistakes.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="case-study-block">
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>Concepting</h4>
						<p>
							With only two weeks, we had to be smart about scope. After initial
							brainstorming, we narrowed down two core directions:
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="accent">
							<strong>Concept 1: Guided Golf Training</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							A semi-realistic simulation where the user holds a virtual club
							and follows on-screen prompts to practice posture, aim, and swing
							timing. The system would provide basic visual feedback and track
							"shots" over a few rounds.
						</p>
						<p>
							This concept leaned more toward education but introduced
							complexity in both physics and gesture design — things we didn’t
							have time to fully prototype.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p class="accent">
							<strong>Concept 2: Smash Golf - A Fun Reflex Challenge</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							A casual arcade-style game where the user deflects golf balls
							coming toward them using only their hands. The more balls they
							deflect, the higher their score. Surrounding 3D objects (like
							vases, TVs, or picture frames) could also be “smashed” to earn
							bonus points.
						</p>
						<p>
							Inspired by games like Fruit Ninja VR and Beat Saber, this concept
							prioritized fun, speed, and accessibility. Perfect for short demos
							at a live event.
						</p>
						<p>After a quick team review, we chose Concept 2.</p>

						<img src="images/golf-02.png" />
					</div>
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>Crafting the Look & Feel</h4>
						<p>
							Even for a lightweight MVP, we wanted the UI to feel polished and
							branded. Key UI elements included:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								A circular countdown timer displayed in the player’s peripheral
								vision.
							</li>
							<li>
								A “Game Over” panel with animated particle effects and confetti
								bursts.
							</li>
							<li>
								Clear iconography and hand-gesture illustrations for basic
								instructions.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
						<p>While it was a small project, the takeaways were huge:</p>
						<div class="feature-cards">
							<div class="feature-card">
								<img src="images/icn-sparkle.svg" />
								<div>
									<p class="accent">Simplicity</p>
									<p>
										Simple concepts work best in VR, especially when users are
										trying something for the first time.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="feature-card">
								<img src="images/icn-flask.svg" />
								<div>
									<p class="accent">Unpredictable</p>
									<p>
										Vision Pro has massive potential, but still lacks maturity
										in tooling and documentation. Planning extra time for
										testing is critical.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="feature-card">
								<img src="images/icn-plant.svg" />
								<div>
									<p class="accent">Evolving</p>
									<p>
										Vision Pro has massive potential, but still lacks maturity
										in tooling and documentation. Planning extra time for
										testing is critical.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="feature-card">
								<img src="images/icn-cube.svg" />
								<div>
									<p class="accent">Spatial</p>
									<p>
										You have to think in 3D. Even if you prototype in 2D, always
										imagine how UI will behave in space, respond to lighting.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>
							<br />Apple’s documentation is gold. Their guidelines saved us
							time, especially around gesture behavior, depth layering, and
							contrast ratios.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="block-content">
						<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
						<p>
							This project was a fast, fun, and eye-opening dive into spatial
							design. While not everything went smoothly, it gave our team
							hands-on experience with emerging XR platforms and helped us lay
							the foundation for future, more ambitious immersive projects.
						</p>
						<p>
							We're excited to continue exploring what’s possible with spatial
							computing and Vision Pro and we now know where to start, what to
							avoid, and how to keep things light, fun, and intuitive.
